.) Overview

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the core of any Windows domain.
It stores and manages information about users, computers, groups, and resources, providing centralized authentication and authorization across the network.

.) Users

Users are security principals—identities that can log in and be granted permissions.

Human users: represent employees.

Service users: used by applications or services (e.g., SQL Server).
Separating them enforces least privilege and improves auditability.

.) Machines

Each joined computer gets a machine account (e.g., PC01$).
These accounts:

Authenticate the device to the domain.

Use long, automatically rotated passwords.

Are local admins on their own host but limited domain-wide.

.) Security Groups

Groups simplify access control by granting permissions collectively.

Group	Role
Domain Admins	Full control of the domain
Server Operators	Manage Domain Controllers
Backup Operators	Bypass file permissions for backups
Account Operators	Create/modify user accounts
.) Organizational Units (OUs)

OUs organize users and computers by department or function and allow:

Group Policy application

Delegated administration

Each object belongs to one OU; for example:
THM → IT → Marketing → Sales

.) Groups vs OUs
	Groups	OUs
Purpose	Permissions	Policy management
Membership	Many per user	One per object
Used for	Access rights	Administration
.) Key Points

AD DS centralizes identity and resource management.

Users, computers, and groups are all security principals.

OUs structure the domain for scalable policy control.

Understanding these objects is vital for both security and administration.
